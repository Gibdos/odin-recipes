    <h2>Delicious vegetarian Eggplant</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggplants</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch strips</li>
        <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce with no salt added</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut eggplants in 1/2, then cut each 1/2 into thirds, leaving 12 eggplant spears total. Place on a baking sheet and brush with 2 tablespoons olive oil.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until fork tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While eggplants are cooking, heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat in a medium to large pan. Add bell pepper, onion, and garlic to the hot pan and cook until onions become tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Remove eggplants from the oven and let cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer eggplants to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Slice each spear vertically using a fork and knife, being careful not to cut through skin. Pry each open and fill with 2 to 3 tablespoons of tomato filling. Cover with tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
